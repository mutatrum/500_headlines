# [@500_headlines](https://twitter.com/500_headlines)

A twitter bot to slowly tweet [500 headlines about bitcoin](https://500headlinesaboutbitcoin.com/).

I only made the bot, the headlines are written by [@kenisajerk](https://twitter.com/kenisajerk).

# Workings

Cron it to run ever half hour. It will tweet every 17.5 hours so it'll take a year to go through them all.
